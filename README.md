This is a CMB-S4 focused python reimplementation of the BICEP multi-component cross-spectral likelihood.

Not yet ready for use -- still missing major components. *C Bischoff, 2024-10-27*

## To-do list

* Bandpower covariance matrix
  - Knox formula bandpower covariance matrix
* Likelihood calculation
  - Foreground models
* Write/read XSpec objects to/from files
* Example scripts
* Package up properly for pip install
