This is a CMB-S4 focused python reimplementation of the BICEP multi-component cross-spectral likelihood.

Not yet ready for use -- still missing major components. *C Bischoff, 2024-08-28*

## To-do list

* Knox formula bandpower covariance matrix
* Bandpower covariance matrix derived from signal and noise sims
* Think about which classes need copy() methods
* Likelihood calculation
* Exercise code on DC11 simulations; use this to generate examples
